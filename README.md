# Six Strings
###### by Brandon David

Six Strings is a React-Redux web app that I made to help me track my progress in guitar songs I'm learning!

## Local Setup
Clone this repo. Then, in the directory:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Features
- Create a new entry with a song name, the artist, difficulty, current progress, and any helpful resources to learning the song.
- Delete an entry from the songs list.
- Checks for malformed song entries.
